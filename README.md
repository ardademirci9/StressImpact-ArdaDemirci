# Stress Impact Analysis During Exam Periods
Hello, I am Arda Demirci (32189). This project is prepared for the **DSA210 course** during the **Fall 2024 semester**.

## Project Overview
During vize and final periods, I often feel the impact of academic stress on my daily habits. I noticed that I tend to walk more or listen to music more frequently during these times, and this made me curious. I wanted to understand if these changes are related to how I cope with stress.

This project explores the impact of academic stress during **vize** and **final exam periods** on daily habits. Specifically, I analyze:
- **Physical Activity**: Daily step count data from Apple Health.
- **Emotional Response**: Music listening and watching patterns from YouTube history.

The goal is to uncover how stress influences these habits and to provide meaningful insights about coping mechanisms during stressful academic periods.

## Data Sources
- **Apple Health**:
  - Step count data covering daily activity.
  - Exported via Apple Health's export feature (in XML format) and processed into JSON for easier analysis.
  - Focused on data starting from **October 2023**.
- **YouTube Music**:
  - Listening history exported via Google Takeout.
  - Includes information such as song titles, timestamps, and platform details.(Focused on only Youtube Music.)

## Tools
- **Python**: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Libraries**:
  - `xml.etree.ElementTree`: Parsing XML data from Apple Health exports.
  - `json`: Reading and writing JSON files.
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and grouping for analysis.
  - `datetime`: Handling and filtering dates.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: (Planned for visualization in future steps).
